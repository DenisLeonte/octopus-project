                        Other than designing and building your website, depending on which bundle you pick, I can insert animations, login form, chatbots, security, backup resource in case of data loss, a personal email, and data storage. 
                        On the premium bundle i will handle the domain and server side.
                        Of course, you can choose to not have all that, if you want it like that. 
                        The main aspect is that having a functional, captivating website is essential to give your project a kick start.

                        The basic bundle consists of a basic website, some side pages(max 10), basic animations, basic text formatting, and scripts but you will have to find a suitable server and domain. 
                        This is perfect if you just want a web designer and you want to DIY the server-side.
                        The website will remain minimalist, but you can change that too.
